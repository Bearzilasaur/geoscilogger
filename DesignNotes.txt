Design Notes

4 Apps


1. Web Map
View core location data
- include three.js in leaflet.js popups to display 3d models
- include links to 3d model viewers (large) and data tables (views) associated with each core
	- Sediment, Diatoms, Pollen, Dating, Sample Logs
	
2. Sample Logger (Blog)
Simple blog format, however must include user defined tags so that samples can be tagged in posts.
This will allow us to query the sample logs to undertand how samples have been processed in the lab.
- Taggin system a la http://howto.philippkeller.com/2005/04/24/Tags-Database-schemas/ 'Scuttle' method
- Might be worthwile implementing a "Toxi" method from the same website so that we can pull sampleID's from
  the samples_table
 
3. Sample Log (Blog) Query
Using methods outlined in http://howto.philippkeller.com/2005/04/24/Tags-Database-schemas/, setup simple
SQL query methods for subsetting all sample logs and then ordering by date.
- Possibly at some point implement a method to collate them.

4. Data Query
All datasets will have a sampleID column, and possibly a coreID column, however with the samples_table this
may be redundant. In any case, data sets should be able to be queried/subsetted by sampleID, coreID or depth
ranges to show relevant data. 


5. DataBase/Table Ingestion from .db and .csv [EXTRA]
Extra app to be developed later, a better method for ingestion of sample processing data.

**NOTE: THIS MAY ACTUALLY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT
